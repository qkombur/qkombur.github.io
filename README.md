## About

<p>Hi, my name is <b>Nicholas Auger</b>, I'm a web developer and designer living in North Carolina.
I like brainstorming and creating, breaking then fixing, and learning something new every day.
</p>
<p>
I can design in <b>Photoshop</b> or in the browser with <b>HTML</b> and <b>CSS</b>.
I can also "wire it all up" with <b>JavaScript</b> and some <b>Vue.js</b>
</p>
