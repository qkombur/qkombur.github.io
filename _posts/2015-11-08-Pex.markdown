Pex is a landing page that was designed by [Blaz Robar.](http://blazrobar.com/2015/free-psd-website-templates/pex-a-free-website-home-page-photoshop-psd/)
I really enjoyed the way the template looked so I decided to build it out using Jekyll and SCSS. 
You can view the website [here](http://www.qkombur.com/Pex). You can see the source code and how I laid it out with Jekyll [here](https://github.com/qkombur/Pex).
Just watch where you step because it's very messy. Anywho I really enjoyed building this and it makes me want to design a landing page. Maybe I'll do that next.
