This is my first blog post. This is also my first 'blog' and I couldn't be happier with the result. For those familiar with Jekyll this is a very basic rework of what happens when you start a new project with Jekyll. But that's fine with me, I don't need anything fancy and I rather liked the default template so I'll keep this like it is until I get bored and redesign. 

This is embrassing but I don't have much else to talk about. I'll make posts about things I learn in the future.
