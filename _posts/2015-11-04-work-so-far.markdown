I noticed I didn't have any of my actual projects listed here so this post will act as a sampling
of some of my favorite pet projects.

# Kyle's Template

My friend kyle is an editor for a creative company in Georgia, I wanted to build a site for him that was
clean and got right to the point. "I'm kyle and here is my work", It's built on scss and I used yeoman to
build and minify the entire site, while gh-pages are used through github to host. Whenever kyle wants to buy a domain name,
he has a site he can use all ready to go.

# Codepen

I use codepen for small little snippets that wouldn't make sense to host on  github. 
[My profile is here.](http://codepen.io/qkombur/)
I'm most proud of this one [here](http://codepen.io/qkombur/pen/dPxjJy). I even gave a little talk about it at the
first codepen meetup in Raleigh!


## but wait there's more!

I'm currently working on a nice little template that I didn't design but someone was very nice and
uploaded a PSD of the design for anyone to develop. I'll make a new post about that one later.
